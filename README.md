## :pushpin: Note
I've made my website open source for your inspiration, motivation, and curiosity.
However, this theme is highly customized and personally tailored, and it would take more work to remove all my custom code than create your own. **I encourage you to be creative and create your own theme, design, and content**.

The [Statik Simple Walkthrough](https://github.com/thanethomson/statik/wiki/Walkthrough) is a great place to start, and is the base for this portfolio.

## :rotating_light: LICENCE
I value keeping this site open source, but as you all know, **plagiarism is bad**. I spent a non-negligible amount of effort developing, designing, and trying to perfect this website, and I am proud of it! All I ask is to not claim this effort as yours.

So, feel free to fork this repo. If you do, please just give me proper credit by linking back to my website, https://dennohpeter.com. Refer to this handy [quora post](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-bad-to-copy-other-peoples-code) if you're not sure what to do. Thanks!
